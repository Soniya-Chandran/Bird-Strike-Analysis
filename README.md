# Bird Strike Analysis 
This is an analysis done on the data relating to the bird strike rate for the period of 20000-2011. I used the Tableau for analysise and visualization purpose.
Bird strike refers to a collision between an airborne animal and an aircraft. 
Bird strikes can have various impacts depending on factors such as the size and speed of the bird, as well as the location of the strike on the aircraft. 
Most accidents occur when a bird (or group of birds) collides with the windscreen or is sucked into the engine of jet aircraft.  
This can occur during takeoff, landing, or during flight. 
Bird strikes can be considered as a severe threat to the aircraft potentially causing damage to the aircraft's structure, engines, or other critical components.

# Bird Strike Analysis 
**Objective**

This is an analysis done on the data relating to the bird strike rate for the period of 20000-2011. I used the Tableau for analysise and visualization purpose.
Bird strike refers to a collision between an airborne animal and an aircraft. 
Bird strikes can have various impacts depending on factors such as the size and speed of the bird, as well as the location of the strike on the aircraft. 
Most accidents occur when a bird (or group of birds) collides with the windscreen or is sucked into the engine of jet aircraft.  
This can occur during takeoff, landing, or during flight. 
Bird strikes can be considered as a severe threat to the aircraft potentially causing damage to the aircraft's structure, engines, or other critical components. 

**Tools Used**

*Tableau - For analysis and data Visualisation
*Microsoft powerpoint- for report preparation

**Case Study**

 ●Visuals Depicting the Number of Bird Strikes 
 
 ●Yearly Analysis & Bird Strikes in the US
 
 ●Top 10 US Airlines in terms of having encountered bird strikes
 
 ●Airports with most incidents of bird strikes – Top 50
 
 ●Yearly Cost Incurred due to Bird Strikes
 
 ●When do most bird strikes occur?
 
 ●Altitude of aeroplanes at the time of strike
 
 ●Phase of flight at the time of the strike.
 
 ●Average Altitude of the aeroplanes in different phases at the time of strike
 
 ●Effect of Bird Strikes & Impact on Flight
 
 ●Effect of Strike at Different Altitude
 
 ●Were Pilots Informed? & Prior Warning and Effect of Strike Relation

 **About the Data**
 The data is collection over the time period of 2000-2011

 There are 25558 Records and 26 features

 Null values are omitted during the visualisation

 Out of these 26 ,some columns shows Null values, count of the same as follows;

   129 Null values:  Aircraft: Type , Airport: Name ,Altitude bin, Wildlife: Number struck , Effect: Impact to flight , Effect: Impact to flight,Flight Date,Aircraft:Airline/Operator,                      When: Phase of flight, Wildlife: Size ,Pilot warned of birds or wildlife? ,Feet above ground, Is Aircraft Large?
   
   267 Null values: Aircraft: Number of engines?
   
   449 Null values: Origin state
   
   4771 Null values: Remarks

**Steps Involved**

  _Step 1_ : 
  Import data to the Tableau.
  
  _Step 2_ : 
  Data cleaning including null values
  
  _Step 3_ : 
  Data processing and Visualisation using charts
  
  _Step 4_ : 
  Dashboard making

**KPIs Extracted**

 * Total Bird Strikes - 25429
   
 * Total Injuries - 21
   
 * Total Cost - $14,22,90,445
   
 * Number of Airports - 292

**Insights**

 Bird strike rate shows an upward trend during the years. 2009 and 2010 are the years  with highest strikes rates. 
 
 Considering the Cost occurred due to damages, in 2001 highest damage happened Around $2,32,52,168 and lowest in 2000
 
 Out of the total, 75.75% of attacks were caused of Small Birds. Attacks caused by Large wildlife are comparatively lower.
 
 California ranks first in number of bird strikes cost incurred
 
 86% of accidents happen in < 1000 ft and 35.7 % in the phase of Approach
 
 Considering the atmospheric conditions, the Bird strikes stands high even if there is no cloud
 
 Only 4.4% of strikes results in a Precautionary landing and 91.8% has not affected the flight
 
 53.6 % of time the pilots are not prior warned of the bird strikes resulting in injured passengers
 
 The difference in damage with regarding the warning is 3705
